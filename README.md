# thirdyearproject

## This is the repository for my third year project, an augmented reality iOS app for new students coming at the Universit of Manchester. 

The app will use ARKit from Apple (https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) anda third party framework (https://github.com/ProjectDent/ARKit-CoreLocation).
The main programming languages are Swift and Objective-C.
